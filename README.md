# :brain: Export ChatGPT

This project was forked from [jcubic/chat-gpt](https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt) and edited to use the original CSS file from ChatGPT website. It consists of a [bookmarklet](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/) that generates and downloads a single HTML file containing the history of the currently opened ChatGPT conversation.

**:exclamation: Don't forget to visit the [original repository](https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt) from which the majority of the code comes!**

# :memo: Changes

All the features from the original project at the fork date, plus:

* ChatGPT styles from their source CSS file hosted here and served through [Raw GitHack](https://raw.githack.com/);
* Customized conversation header to show not only the model but also the chat title;
* Minor code styles changes and formatting edits.

# :star: Use

1. Copy the code from [`./bookmark.js`](https://github.com/gvmossato/export-chat-gpt/blob/master/bookmark.js);

2. Create a new bookmark:
    * Set the bookmark name as you wish;
    * Paste the copied code in the URL field.

3. Open the ChatGPT conversation to export and just click the bookmark from the favorites bar.
